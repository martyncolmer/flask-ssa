# Flask Foundation
This application is a solid foundation for flask applications, built with best practices, that you can easily construct 
your website/webapp off of. This application is different from most Flask frameworks as it does not assume anything about your development or production environments. 

#### Usage:
Rename the settings and config templates and populate with your own keys and DB connections.
